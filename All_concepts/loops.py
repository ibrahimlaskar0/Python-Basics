#for loop
for i in range(5):
   print(i)


#while loop
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1  
    
# how it works is it starts with count 0 and it go for 5 times since 0 1 2 3 4 is less thn 5 and then i will print again the same it will add 1 and print it will continue till it reach 5
# if i put count before rint it will
#first add 1 and then start so output would be 1 2 3 4 5
